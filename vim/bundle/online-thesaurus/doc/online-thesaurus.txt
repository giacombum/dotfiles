INTRODUCTION                                                *online-thesaurus*

This plugin provides a command for looking up words in an online thesaurus,
which is at the moment configured to be http://thesaurus.com/

The plugin displays the definition of the word under the cursor and a list of
synonyms.

The credit for the original idea and code goes to Nick Coleman:

MAPPINGS                                           *online-thesaurus-mappings*

                                                      *:OnlineThesaurusLookup*
The plugin provides the |:OnlineThesaurusLookup| command to look up the current
word under the cursor in an online thesaurus. The command makes a request to
http://thesaurus.com/, parses results, and displays them in a vertical split in
the bottom.

By default the |:OnlineThesaurusLookup| command is mapped to '<LocalLeader>K'.
If you haven't remapped <LocalLeader>, it defaults to '\'. To close the split,
just press 'q'.

CUSTOMIZATION                                 *online-thesaurus-customization*

                                                 *g:online_thesaurus_map_keys*
If you want to disable the default key binding, add the following line to your
|.vimrc|:
>
  let g:online_thesaurus_map_keys = 1
<
Then you can map the |:OnlineThesaurusLookup| command to anything you want as
follows:
>
  nnoremap <your key binding> :OnlineThesaurusLookup<CR>
<
